# <!-- CourseMate AI is an AI-powered study assistant designed to help students interact with their learning materials more 
# efficiently. Modern students rely on multiple sources of study material such as lecture notes, textbooks, PDFs, and 
# research papers. These documents are often long and difficult to navigate, making it time-consuming to find specific information. -->


# By leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), CourseMate AI combines document retrieval with large language models to 
# provide context-aware explanations, summaries, and answers from the student's own study resources.




# Development plan
# Step 1 – User Uploads Study Material

# User Uploads Study Material

# Students upload learning resources such as:

# PDFs
# lecture notes
# textbooks
# research papers





# Step 2 – Document Loading

# The system loads documents using document loaders.

# Goal:
# Convert raw files into document objects that can be processed.

# You may clean the document as well.




# Step 3 – Text Splitting (Chunking)

# Documents are usually too large for LLM context windows.
# So we split them into smaller chunks.

# Chunking improves retrieval accuracy.




# Step 4 – Embedding Generation

# Each chunk is converted into a vector embedding.
# Embedding models transform text into numerical vectors.

# "Gradient Descent Optimization"
# ↓
# [0.23, -0.81, 0.44, ...]
 
# These vectors represent semantic meaning.



# Step 5 – Vector Database Storage

# All embeddings are stored inside a vector database.

# The vector database stores:

# embeddings
# original text chunks
# metadata






# Step 6 – User Asks a Question

# Now the student interacts with the system.







# Step 7 – Query Embedding

# The question is also converted into an embedding.







# Step 8 – Similarity Search

# The vector database performs semantic similarity search.

# Goal:
# Find chunks that are most relevant to the question.






# Step 9 – Retriever Component

# The retriever selects the top-k relevant chunks.
# These chunks form the context.





# Step 10 – LLM Answers

# Based on the context, the LLM answers.
